PROJECT TODO:
- CAD enclosure for both motors + solenoid
- figure out how to elongate cables for motor 2 + solenoid
- test print gears
- make the main holder rod out of something threaded so I can put a nut on the bottom to hold up the bearing (bonus: adjustable!)
- so much god damn coding
    - motor control
    - 2d image conversion to gcode
- limits or limit switches or something for calibration
- h bridge or better motor controllers to enable changing direction
42.525
- mounting second arm motor (atm will definitely do all sorts of rubbing against the first arm)
- RelatedP: countersink the key in the pinion to give more clearance from the arm
- measure bolts to see how much they can be countersunk
