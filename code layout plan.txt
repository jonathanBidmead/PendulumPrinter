what do I need the arduino code to do?

- I give it a timeseries of xy co ords and it goes to those points
- I tell it when to raise and lower the pen

- 2 PI(D) loops, one for each motor
- I'd prefer not to have to delve too deep into interrupts so try to make things non-blocking

- I should really get some limit switches but for now I guess it's fine

STATES

- Initialise: Zero Calibration
    - User is able to nudge the arms to the zero position using the serial monitor
    - Pen is raised immediately

- Operation:
    - Dynamic reference begins as soon as the start button is pressed
    - Need to take care that the arms move in tandem correctly. Actually I don't care about that issue from 322 because the pen would be raised for that
    - Define a function for flipping motor direction
